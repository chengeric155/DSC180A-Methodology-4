## Questions 
What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
    **I think the most interesting topic is the edge of stability. I just find it perplexing how the maximum eigenvalue hovers around the specific value $\frac{2}{\sqrt{\text{step size}}}$.**

Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
    **I am interested in investigating topics like edge of stability, loss plateaus, and grokking for quarter 2 as they have a mystery to them.**

What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
    **I definitely would have tried to take a more theorical approach to my topic, as opposed to experimenting with how SWA interacts with different factors. Finding out why something happens will probably be my next goal, as some theory will be necessary.**

What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
    **One thing I want to try is to map out the loss area to maybe find geographical explanation on how SWA leads to better generalization.**
